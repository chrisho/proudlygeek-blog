About Me
========

My name is Gianluca Bargelli and i'm a software developer.

I simply love to program because *coding* makes me (*almost*) feel happy.

My interests as a developer ranges from *web development* to *desktop* and *mobile*: i still had to find my field, so i try to approach all that sort of things that tickles my curiosity.

I live in a very small town near Perugia, Italy but i'm planning to move shortly since i'm looking for a job.

Other things i **love** to do in my spare time are:

*  Read books;
*  Listen music;
*  Playing guitar and drums;
*  Take very long walks;
*  Enlarge my vinyl records collection.

About this Website
==================

This site is mainly used as a web log of my *coding* activies/experiments and related topics such as *programming languages*, *tools*, *algorithms* ecc.
I'll try to write as much as possible even if i'm not a great *writer* so expect a lot of **low**, **boring** and **useless** posts. I warned *you*.

What runs behind?
=================
This weblog was entirely built from scratch using [Flask][1], a very minimal python framework built on the top of Werkzeug.
